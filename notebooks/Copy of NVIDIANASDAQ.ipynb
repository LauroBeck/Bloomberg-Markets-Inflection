Discuss how the H-CX-H sandwich could model an interaction or influence where one market's state affects the other's phase, leading to a potential 'phase-flip' in their relationship.\n","\n","### Explanation of H-CX-H Logic\n","\n","#### 1. The H-CX-H Gate Sequence and its Purpose\n","\n","The H-CX-H (Hadamard-CNOT-Hadamard) gate sequence is a fundamental quantum operation used to transform a CNOT gate. Let's break down its components:\n","\n","*   **Hadamard (H) Gate**: The Hadamard gate is a single-qubit gate that creates superposition. It transforms a computational basis state $|0\\rangle$ to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$ (often denoted as $|+\\rangle$) and $|1\\rangle$ to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$ (often denoted as $|-\\rangle$). Essentially, it changes the basis from the Z-basis (computational basis) to the X-basis and vice-versa.\n","\n","*   **Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate**: The CNOT gate is a two-qubit gate with a control qubit and a target qubit. If the control qubit is in state $|1\\rangle$, it flips the state of the target qubit. If the control qubit is in state $|0\\rangle$, the target qubit remains unchanged. It operates in the computational (Z) basis.\n","\n","When you sandwich a CNOT gate between Hadamard gates on the *target* qubit, as in H-CX-H (where H is applied to the target qubit both before and after the CNOT), the entire sequence effectively transforms the CNOT gate into a **Controlled-Z (CZ) gate**.\n","\n","Mathematically, applying an H gate to the target qubit (qubit $T$) before and after a CNOT (with control $C$ and target $T$) changes the CNOT behavior:\n","\n","$H_T \\cdot CNOT_{C,T} \\cdot H_T = CZ_{C,T}$\n","\n","The CZ gate applies a phase of -1 to the state $|11\\rangle$ (when both control and target are in state $|1\\rangle$) and leaves all other computational basis states ($|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$) unchanged. It introduces entanglement and is a crucial gate for quantum computation.\n","\n","Alternatively, if Hadamard gates are applied to *both* the control and target qubits (on one or both sides of the CNOT), the CNOT operation effectively switches its basis of operation. Specifically, applying Hadamard gates to both qubits, then a CNOT, then Hadamard gates again, effectively performs a CNOT gate in the X-basis (i.e., a controlled-X flip in the X-basis).\n","\n","In our context, the `h $1; cx $1, $0; h $1;` sequence has qubit `1` as the control and qubit `0` as the target for the CNOT. However, the Hadamard gates are applied only to qubit `1` (the control). This specific sequence: `H_control CNOT_{control,target} H_control` is not a direct CZ transformation. It's more complex, effectively swapping the control and target roles if CNOT is viewed as symmetric under H-transformations.\n","\n","Let's re-evaluate: The sequence is `h $1; cx $1, $0; h $1;`. Here, qubit $1$ is the control and qubit $0$ is the target. The Hadamards are applied to the *control* qubit ($1$). This specific sequence is equivalent to `CX $0, $1` (i.e., a CNOT where $0$ is the control and $1$ is the target). This implies a switch in which market is controlling the other, or rather, it changes the basis in which qubit 1 is acting as a control.\n","\n","#### 2. Effect on the Quantum State of Qubits $1$ and $0$\n","\n","Given the sequence `H $1; CX $1, $0; H $1;`:\n","\n","*   **Initial State**: Let the initial state of the two qubits be $|q_1 q_0\\rangle$.\n","*   **First Hadamard ($H_1$)**: $H$ is applied to qubit $1$. This places qubit $1$ into a superposition of its computational basis states, or transforms it from Z-basis to X-basis. For example, if $q_1 = |0\\rangle$, it becomes $|+\\rangle_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_1 + |1\\rangle_1)$. If $q_1 = |1\\rangle$, it becomes $|-\\rangle_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_1 - |1\\rangle_1)$.\n","*   **CNOT ($CX_{1,0}$)**: Qubit $1$ acts as the control, and qubit $0$ is the target. If qubit $1$ is in $|1\\rangle$ (in the Z-basis), qubit $0$ is flipped. Because qubit $1$ is in a superposition (after the first H), the CNOT gate will create entanglement between qubit $1$ and qubit $0$. For instance, if the initial state was $|00\\rangle$, after $H_1$, it becomes $|+0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$. Applying $CX_{1,0}$ to this state yields $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$, which is a Bell state.\n","*   **Second Hadamard ($H_1$)**: Another $H$ gate is applied to qubit $1$. This transforms qubit $1$ back from the X-basis to the Z-basis. The effect is to"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bf8fdac3"},"source":["transform the CNOT gate such that qubit $0$ acts as the control and qubit $1$ as the target.

is unlikely to \"phase-flip\" the bearishness in Nvidia/Nasdaq. The simulation shows a very low probability (approximately 5%) of Nvidia/Nasdaq becoming bullish when KOSPI/Nikkei is bullish, compared to a high probability (approximately 95%) of Nvidia/Nasdaq remaining bearish under the same conditions.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   The `qasm_code` was successfully modified to include an H-CX-H gate sequence (`h $1; cx $1, $0; h $1;`) between physical qubits $1$ (Nvidia/Nasdaq) and $0$ (KOSPI/Nikkei), and the updated circuit was loaded and visualized.\n","*   The H-CX-H sandwich, with Hadamards applied to the control qubit, was theoretically shown to be equivalent to swapping the control and target qubits of the CNOT gate (i.e., `H_1 CX_{1,0} H_1` is equivalent to `CX_{0,1}`). This implies a reversal in the direction of influence between the two market indicators.\n","*   This quantum operation was interpreted as introducing \"phase friction\" (relative phase shifts) and a potential \"phase-flip\" (reversal of influence direction) between the represented market indicators.\n","*   Simulation of the modified quantum circuit using Qiskit Aer with 1024 shots was successfully performed, and measurement counts were obtained.\n","*   The measurement results, when visualized as a bar chart, confirmed the distribution of outcomes.\n","*   Analysis of the simulation results revealed that in 21 out of 1024 total shots where KOSPI/Nikkei (qubit 0) showed bullish momentum (`'1'`), Nvidia/Nasdaq (qubit 1) remained bearish (`'0'`) in 20 instances.\n","*   Conversely, in only 1 instance out of these 21 (approximately 5%), Nvidia/Nasdaq \"phase-flipped\" to bullish (`'1'`) when KOSPI/Nikkei was bullish.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The current quantum circuit configuration suggests that the designed \"phase-flip\" mechanism, while theoretically present, does not strongly manifest a change from bearish to bullish for Nvidia/Nasdaq under bullish KOSPI/Nikkei conditions based on the given parameters.\n","*   Future explorations could involve tuning the initial rotation parameters or the RZZ gate angle, or experimenting with alternative entanglement structures to investigate if a higher probability of the desired \"phase-flip\" can be achieved, thereby providing a stronger quantum-derived prediction for market reversals.\n"]}]}
